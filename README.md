<b>Prereqs:</b><br>
This code assumes you have Python and a local MySQL database installed on your machine

You'll also need to install Python-Twitter (https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)

And sign up for a Twitter developer account (it's eay, free, and takes 2 minutes - https://dev.twitter.com/)


My code isn't perfect, but it works. Have fun with it, make it better.
